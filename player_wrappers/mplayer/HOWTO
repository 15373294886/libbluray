HOW TO PATCH MPLAYER
====================

Tested with mplayer svn revision r30230.

1. Get mplayer from repository:

	svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk mplayer
	
2. Change into mplayer/ and apply the patch:

	patch -p1 < mplayer.patch

3. Configure mplayer and build it 

	./configure && make

4. Copy a libbluray keyfile to mplayer/ and name it keys.bin

5. Run ./mplayer passing it a bd:// url as follows:

	./mplayer bd://<title>/path/to/disc
	
	e.g.
	
	./mplayer bd://1/mnt/BLURAY_DISC	(<-- to play 00001.m2ts on disc /mnt/BLURAY_DISC)


NOTE:
Before running mplayer, you can turn off all libbluray debug messages using 'export BD_DEBUG_MASK=0'.
This will help with performance and clean up your terminal.
You can also use different mplayer options such as caching, different VOs etc to ensure a smooth playback.
